<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I am Tejas Kumar Singh currently doing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Galgotias University. This is first sample webpage developed by me. I am from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh. I completed my class 10th from St. Thomas Inter Collage,Khalilabad and then shifted in Kota for further studies. Then i returned back and completed my class 12th from Divine Public School,Gorakhpur. My hobby is to just study and study about programming and go as far as i can go in this field. The only reason for my interest in programming is because programming has no limits. The more you learn about it, the more you want to learn about it. My future plans are very simple. I just wanna go out and drill my skills for more innovative ideas and get experience in the field i like the most. This is the very first page developed by me as assignment in Subject <i>Computer Workshop. </i><b>Let's go futher and check it out</b></p>
